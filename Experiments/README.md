The preprocessing of WiFi signals can be implemented via the MATLAB WLAN Toolbox, for instance, referring to the following resource: https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/wlan/ug/basic-wlan-link-modeling.html.

The InceptionTime model is developed based on the original code, which can be found at: https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime. If this proves useful for your research work, please kindly cite the reference [R2].

The LSTM and Transformer models are built upon the code accessible via the link provided here: https://github.com/gxhen/receiverAgnosticRFFI. If this proves useful for your research work, please kindly cite the reference [R3].
